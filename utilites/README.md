# Utility Scripts
This folder contains utility python programs for extracting information from logs generated by Darknet when running YOLOv3

- convert_test_results_to_average_inference.py Takes in a "result" log generated when running inference using ./darknet detector test with output to a log file.
  The file searches the log and extracts the resulting prediction time per image instance and reports back the average inference/prediction time.
  
- convert_training_log_to_csv Extracts information from a log file containing the output of Darknet when training YOLOv3.
  This includes itteration, average and total loss. This is written to a CSV file for further analysis.
