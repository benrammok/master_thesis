# Utility Scripts
This folder contains utility python programs for extracting information from logs generated by Darknet when running YOLOv3

- convert_test_results_to_average_inference.py Takes in a "result" log generated when running inference using ./darknet detector test with output to a log file.
  The file searches the log and extracts the resulting prediction time per image instance and reports back the average inference/prediction time.
  It does not yet distinguish milliseconds from seconds, in case of reported seconds, take 1/inference time to get FPS, this will be changed later
  
- convert_training_log_to_csv Extracts information from a log file containing the output of Darknet when training YOLOv3.
  This includes itteration, average and total loss. This is written to a CSV file for further analysis. 

- test_frozen_graph, takes three inputs; -i (IMAGE), -m (MODEL) and -l (LABEL). Uses tensorflow, CV2 and the Tensorflow Object Detection API to test a frozen pb graph.
  Follow the instructions on https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md to get the Object Detection API up and running.
